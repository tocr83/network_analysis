# network_analysis

This project conducts a network analysis of Facebook friends. 

It first creates a network graph to display the overall structure. 

Subsequently we calculate some important network metrics to understand some of the fundamental properties of its topology. 

Lastly, with these insights it revisualizes the network graphs by (i) emphasising more central nodes and (ii) detect communities in the network.
